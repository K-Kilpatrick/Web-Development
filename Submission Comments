Greetings, Kelly!



Congratulations to you on the successful completion of your recent review assignment on secure web application development. Your commitment to exploring essential topics such as the HTTP protocol, the 'curl' command-line web client, containerization, and backend databases is truly commendable. I appreciate the diligence and effort you've invested in this assignment.



I have carefully reviewed your submission and would like to acknowledge your dedication. However, upon examination, it appears that question 27 requires attention.





Question 27: While backend service are indeed a part of the database system, the question is more focused on a specific service. Revisit your response to ensure you are addressing the specific service in question for greater precision.





I encourage you to revisit relevant materials and resources to strengthen your understanding further. Your overall performance is commendable, and I applaud the thoroughness displayed in the remainder of your responses.



Moving forward, I encourage you to maintain this level of excellence and enthusiasm. Your commitment to mastering these concepts will undoubtedly pave the way for future success in cybersecurity.



Thank you for your ongoing commitment to excellence in your studies. I eagerly anticipate witnessing your continued progress in the course.
