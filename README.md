# Web-Development
Module 12: HTTP with Sessions and Cookies, Microservices and Web Application Architecture, 

Module Description
In this module, you'll learn about web application architecture and the web client–server model HTTP communication process.

On Day 1, we will cover the HTTP communication process in the web client–server model. We will then look at how sessions are managed by web applications using cookies.

On Day 2, we will cover modern web application architecture and web application software "stacks" and how to deploy web application container sets and create SQL queries to manage data in databases.

Module Objectives

Day 1: HTTP with Sessions and Cookies

Understand HTTP requests and responses.
Use the curl command-line tool to make GET and POST requests and examine the responses.
Manage cookies using the Chrome extension Cookie-Editor.
Use Chrome's Developer Tools to audit HTTP request and response headers.

Day 2: Microservices and Web Application Architecture

Understand how microservices and architecture work to deliver more robust, reliable, and repeatable infrastructure as code.
Define the different services within a LEMP stack.
Deploy a Docker Compose container set and test the deployment's functionality.
Describe how relational databases store and retrieve data.
Create SQL queries to view, enter, and delete data

Lab Environment
You will continue to use your Web Lab virtual machine for today's activities.
